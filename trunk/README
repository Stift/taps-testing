Taps is a test tool for the .NET framework. It is inspired on Perl's
testing facilities and therefore quite different from the likes of
tools like NUnit. tap.exe runs test scripts and expects to see output
that conforms to the TAP protocol on their stdouts.

Installation
------------

You can install Taps using the binary installer. The binary installer
installs Taps with documentation and samples in ProgramFiles/Taps and
puts a copy of tap.exe in SystemRoot\System32 so it appears in the
path. The installer adds an item 'Taps' in the start menu with links
to the documentation and the uninstaller.

If you want to compile Taps yourself you can do so by running make.pl
in the tap/tap directory. Compiling Taps requires that the .NET
framework v3.5 is installed on your system. To compile the
documentation run make.pl in the tap/doc directory. Compiling the
documentation requires xsltproc and docbook xsls; see
docbook.sourceforge.net.
